Lukan Doom 
Design Document


Main Goals:
1. .WAD editing and publishing tools 100% compatible with ID Tech 1
2. .LWAD format to add some enhancements to the format
3. Run .WADs in editor

Unlike other Doom Editors I am trying to make an all-in-one package similar to GameMaker itself.
Lukan Doom(or possibly LDoom for short) will not distribute or contain any of Doom's original assets, but should be able to run DOOM.WAD 100%
